# SI506-practice

Retired problem sets and lab exercises made available to SI 506 students for additional practice.

## Files

Each problem set and lab exercise contains the following files:

1. `README.md` (instructions)
2. `problem_set_XX.py` or `lab_exercise_XX.py` (template/submission file)
3. `problem_set_XX_solution.py` or `lab_exercise_XX_solution.py` (solution file)
4. For certain assignments data files are also included.

## Accessing the files

### Github users

Students with a Github account who are familiar with Git commands and Github practices should fork
and/or clone this repository to access the files.

### Non-Github users

Github does not provide a simple file download option for non-Github users. Instead, acquiring
content requires the following steps:

1. Click on either the `lab_exercises/` or `problem_sets/` directory and select a lab exercise or
problem set directory of interest.
2. Click on a file in the directory (e.g. `README.md`).
3. Click the `raw` button.
4. Right click over the browser window and select `Save as . . .` (or similar command).
5. Save file to local machine.
6. Repeat for all other files in the directory.

## Gradescope submission

After completing the assignment upload your assigment submission to Gradescope "SI 506 Study
Problems" for scoring.
