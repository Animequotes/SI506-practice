# BACKGROUND

# On Wednesday, August 28, 1963, a march to advocate for the civil and economic rights
# of African Americans was held in Washington, D.C. It was called
# the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and was organized by A. Philip Randolph
# and Bayard Rustin. Around 250,000 people participated with speakers from civil rights,
# labor and religious organizations. The march helped spur passage of the
# Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion,
# sex or national origin.

# class = 'March on Washington'
# event name = 'March on Washington'
# $event_name = 'March on Washington'
# event_name = 'March on Washington'

# Concatenate the text "for Jobs and Freedom" to the value of the variable selected.
# Write code below.



# print() the variable below.



# Determine the number of characters of your new string value.

I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up
and live out the true meaning of its creed:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia,
the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners
will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi,
a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,
sweltering with the heat of oppression,
will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists,
with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification"
-- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands
with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted,
and every hill and mountain shall be made low,
the rough places will be made plain,
and the crooked places will be made straight;
"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."
