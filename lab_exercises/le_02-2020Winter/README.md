# SI 506: Lab Exercise 02

## This Week's Lab

This week's lab exercise includes two (2) one to two line problems that focus on variables creation and value assignment, string concatenation, and use a certain built-in function discussed in the lectures and the readings.

## Background

On Wednesday, August 28, 1963, a march to advocate for the civil and economic rights of African Americans was held in Washington, D.C. It was called the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and was organized by A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin. Around 250,000 people participated with speakers from civil rights, labor and religious organizations. The march helped spur passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.

## 1.0 Problem 01 (10 Points)

1. Uncomment the variable name and assigned value that adheres to the Python style guide. (See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names)

:bulb: Uncomment means removing the hash symbol ('#') and any leading whitespace in front of the variable name.\
:warning: Choose wisely or you will trigger a syntax error.

2. Concatenate the text "for Jobs and Freedom" to the value of the variable selected above using the appropriate operator.
3. Write a `print()` statement that prints the variable value to the screen.
4. Replace the default value assigned to the variable `num_chars` with the number of characters of your new string value using the appropriate built-in function.

:bulb: Replace the default value of `None`.

## 2.0 Problem 02 (10 Points)

### 2.1 SETUP

The multi-line string `i_have_a_dream` is an excerpt from the powerful speech given by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1963.

```python
i_have_a_dream = """
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up
and live out the true meaning of its creed:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."

I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia,
the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners
will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi,
a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,
sweltering with the heat of oppression,
will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists,
with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification"
-- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands
with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted,
and every hill and mountain shall be made low,
the rough places will be made plain,
and the crooked places will be made straight;
"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."
"""
```

### 2.2 Problem

Determine the number of words in `i_have_a_dream`, and assign that number to the variable `number_words`. Then, determine the number of lines in `i_have_a_dream`,and assign that number to `number_lines`.

:bulb: Replace the default value of `None`.
