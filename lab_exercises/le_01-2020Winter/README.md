# SI 506: Lab Exercise 01

## This Week's Lab Exercise
This week's lab exercise includes two (2) one to two line problems that focus on variables
creation and value assignment. The primary goal of this lab assignment is simply to provide
you with an early introduction to Python variables and to make sure your editor and environment
are set up correctly (some of the code here will only run if you have Python 3 installed).

## 1.0 Problem 01 (Points 10)
Using a code editor of your choice, edit the below lines so that the variables `name`,
`class_number`, and `editor` have a value of your name, the class number (506), and the editor
program you used to edit this file, respectively.

## 2.0 Problem 02 (Points 10)
Create a list object named `my_first_list` that containts `name`, `class_number`, and `editor`,
in that order.
