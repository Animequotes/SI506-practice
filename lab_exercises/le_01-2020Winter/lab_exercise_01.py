# print a new line (which is what the "\n" stands for)
print('Lab Exercise 01 \n')


# PROBLEM 1 (10 points)
# Replace 'your_name_here' with your name.
# Replace '100' with the class number.
# Replace 'your_editor_here' with your editor of choice.

# BEGIN SOLUTION 1

name = "your_name_here" # <- make sure this has quotes around it so that it is a string variable
class_number = 100 # <- no quotes required here because it is an integer variable
editor = "your_editor_here" # <- again, make sure this has quotes around it

# END SOLUTION 1


# PROBLEM 2 (10 points)
# The list object named <my_first_list> should contain <name>, <class_number>, and <editor>,
# in that order.

# BEGIN SOLUTION 2

my_first_list = []

# END SOLUTION 2
